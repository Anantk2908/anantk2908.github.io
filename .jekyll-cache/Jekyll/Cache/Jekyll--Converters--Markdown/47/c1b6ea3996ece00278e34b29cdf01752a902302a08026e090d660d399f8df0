<h3 id="0-installing-ubuntu">0. Installing Ubuntu</h3>

<p>In this task we were supposed to install ubuntu it was pretty straightforward but the encryption on the SSD was minor barrier as I had hard time disabling it.</p>

<h3 id="1-star-me">1. Star Me</h3>

<p>In this task we were supposed to star the amfoss repositories.To help us for the task we were given a script for the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this task I learned the console in the inspect element of our browser.</p>

<h3 id="2-codeforces-and-hackkerank">2. Codeforces and Hackkerank</h3>

<p>This task got me more familiar to the python syntax as some of them required lists etc.Some of them also required maths logic.</p>

<p>In this task I learned about different type of errors you get while solving such question.Most common error while submitting was the runtime error which sometimes required me to re-think my logic.</p>

<h3 id="3-ruby-scraper">3. Ruby Scraper</h3>

<p>This task was about scraping the google search result and showing them.So for this task we required some ruby ‚Äúgems‚Äù(which was essentially libraries in python).So I gem installed all the gems individually to later learning that you can install all of them by using a GEMFILE.The gems I used for the task was nokogiri,byebug,HTTParty</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this task I learned about ruby syntax.The byebug gem was also an helpful gem as it helped in quickly finding the CSS element required to scrape google/</p>

<h3 id="4-get-it-using-javascript">4. Get it using javascript</h3>

<p>In this task we were required to fetch the information of a github user by taking username as input we were required to make a html page for the same.This task was the hardest as graphql being a new api there was nothing about it except the official documentation.The main thing was making the query as it is a query language</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this task I learned about graphql and getelementbyid in html.</p>
